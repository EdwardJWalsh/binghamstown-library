                    Here at Binghamstown library we believe in nurtring a life long love of reading from an early age. We have carefully curated an extensive collection of childrens books which we hope will spark a love of story telling and foster a deep appreciation for the love of reading. This is why we offer our 'Interactive Storytime' sessions. Let our animated story tellers bring all of your childrens favourite characters to life in a way which is both immersive and entertaining. Children are encouraged to suggest their favourite books for our storytellers to bring to life. Read-with-me sessions take place every Saturday at 12pm.
