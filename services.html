                        Here at Binghamstown library we believe in nurturing a life long love of reading from an early age. We have carefully curated an extensive collection of childrens books which we hope will spark a love of story telling and foster a deep appreciation for the love of reading. This is why we offer our 'Interactive Storytime' sessions. Let our animated story tellers bring all of your childrens favourite characters to life in a way which is both immersive and entertaining. Children are encouraged to suggest their favourite books for our storytellers to bring to life. Read-with-me sessions take place every Saturday at 12pm.

                        New technology can be daunting no matter what age you are but if you are from the generation that didn't grow up with the internet or with a device constantly in your hand it can be especially daunting. Join one of our computer classes and let our IT specialist Derek guide you through the information super highway in a way that is catered to anyone with any level of experience. We are confident that in no time at all you will be able to keep up with the younger generation. Topics covered include 'How to use Google', 'Sending e-mails' and 'Setting up a social media profile' among many many others. Join us on Thursday evenings at 6pm. Register your interest at the bottom of this page or in-person at any time by speaking to one of our librarians.
