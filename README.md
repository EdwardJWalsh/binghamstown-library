# Testing

* I tested the page in different browsers to make sure it works properly in Chrome, Firefox and Opera.
* I confirmed that the navigation bar and menu still worked and all sections were readable.
* I confirmed that the register form works.

# Bugs

* I found that my images were not showing up in browsers after deploying the site, this was because I used absolute file paths in stead of relative ones. After changing these the images showed up correctly.
* The images and text in the 'services' section were not stacking as I would like them to when I deployed the site. I was able to fix this using media queries.
* I found that the text in the logo migrated down to the div below this when viewed on smaller screens. I suspected this is due to my query media settings, I was able to fix this after changing my media query settings.
